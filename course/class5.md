# Additional Tooling

Pentesting, or penetration testing, is the practice of testing computer systems and networks to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. To perform a successful pentest, it's important to have the right tools in your toolkit. In this article, we'll discuss three of the most commonly used pentest tools: Nmap, Nessus, and Nuclei.

## Nmap
Nmap (Network Mapper) is a free and open-source tool that is widely used for network exploration and security auditing. Nmap is versatile and can be used for a variety of tasks, including:

* Mapping network devices and their open ports
* Detecting the operating system and services running on a target
* Scanning for vulnerabilities and security threats
* Performing vulnerability scans
* Launching exploits against discovered vulnerabilities

One of the unique features of Nmap is its ability to run Nmap scripts. Nmap scripts are small programs that can be used to automate various tasks, such as vulnerability scanning and exploitation. Nmap scripts are written in the Lua programming language and can be customized to meet specific needs.

## Nessus
Nessus is a proprietary vulnerability scanner that is used to identify security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations on systems and networks. Nessus uses a plugin-based architecture to scan for vulnerabilities, with over 160,000 plugins available for use. Nessus is widely used by security professionals and is known for its ease of use, speed, and accuracy.

## Nuclei
Nuclei is a fast and versatile tool that is used to automate the process of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications. Nuclei is designed to be fast, flexible, and easy to use, and it can be used to discover a wide range of vulnerabilities, including:

* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Remote Code Execution (RCE)
* SQL Injection

Nuclei can be used to scan web applications for vulnerabilities, and it also has the ability to launch exploits against discovered vulnerabilities. Nuclei is fast and can scan large numbers of web applications in a short amount of time, making it an effective tool for automating the pentesting process.

In conclusion, Nmap, Nessus, and Nuclei are all powerful and versatile pentest tools that are widely used by security professionals. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced pentester, these tools can help you to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in your systems and networks. By mastering the basic usage of these tools, you can improve your skills and better protect your systems and networks against security threats.
