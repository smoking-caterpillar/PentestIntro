# Password Cracking
Password cracking is a technique used by attackers to gain unauthorised access to systems and data by cracking passwords. The aim of password cracking is to uncover passwords that have been lost, forgotten, or otherwise unknown, and to use those passwords to gain access to sensitive systems, data, or accounts.

Password cracking can be accomplished using a variety of methods, including brute force attacks, dictionary attacks, and rainbow table attacks. In a brute force attack, the attacker uses a programme to systematically try every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. This can be time-consuming, but is often effective if the password is short or weak.

Dictionary attacks are similar to brute force attacks, but instead of trying every possible combination of characters, the attacker uses a dictionary of commonly used passwords or words to crack the password. This is often more efficient than brute force attacks, but is only effective if the password is a word or a variation of a word found in the dictionary.

Rainbow table attacks are a more advanced form of password cracking that uses pre-computed tables of hashes to quickly crack passwords. The tables are generated using a large number of hashes, and are used to quickly match a hash with its corresponding password. This can be a highly effective method for cracking passwords, but is often limited by the size of the rainbow table and the speed of the computer used to generate it.

It is important to note that password cracking is illegal in many jurisdictions, and can result in serious consequences if performed without proper authorisation. Additionally, password cracking can cause significant harm to organisations and individuals if sensitive information is uncovered.

To prevent password cracking, it is important to follow best practices for password security. This includes using strong and complex passwords that are at least 8 characters in length and contain a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords should also be changed regularly and should not be reused across multiple accounts.

In conclusion, password cracking is a serious threat to the security of systems and data. It is important to be aware of the methods used by attackers to crack passwords and to follow best practices for password security to reduce the risk of a successful attack. By doing so, individuals and organisations can help to protect their sensitive information and reduce the risk of unauthorised access.

## Exercise: Cracking Passwords from a Shadow File

As part of the Attacks and Payloads class, you have copied a Linux shadow file from a vulnerable web application. The aim of this exercise is to crack the passwords in the shadow file using John the Ripper, a popular open-source password cracking tool.

Step 1: Install John the Ripper

To install John the Ripper, you can use the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install john
```

Step 2: Crack the Passwords

To crack the passwords in the shadow file, you'll need to run the following command:
```
john /path/to/shadow_file
```

This will start the password cracking process, which may take some time, depending on the size of the shadow file and the complexity of the passwords.

Step 3: View the Results

When John the Ripper has finished cracking the passwords, you can view the results by running the following command:
```
john /path/to/shadow_file --show
```

It's important to remember that cracking passwords is illegal in many jurisdictions and can result in serious consequences if performed without proper authorisation. This exercise is intended for educational purposes only and should not be attempted on any system or data without proper authorisation.
