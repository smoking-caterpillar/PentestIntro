# Nmap Intro

Nmap, short for Network Mapper, is a free and open-source tool used for network exploration, management, and security auditing. Nmap is widely used by network administrators, security professionals, and pentesters to identify and map network devices, as well as to detect vulnerabilities and security threats.

Nmap works by sending specially crafted packets to the target host or network, and then analyzing the responses to determine information about the target, including the operating system, open ports, and running services. Nmap can also be used to perform vulnerability scans, and to launch exploits against discovered vulnerabilities.

For beginners, Nmap is relatively easy to use, with a simple command-line interface. However, it can be difficult to understand the output generated by Nmap, especially if you are new to networking and security concepts.

One of the most common uses of Nmap is to scan for open ports on a target host. This can be useful for identifying which services are running on the target, and for detecting potential vulnerabilities.

To scan for open TCP ports on a target host using Nmap, you can use the following command:
```
nmap -p 1-65535 <hostname>
```
For example, to scan for open TCP ports on the host named "nmapme.labs.internal", you would use the following command:
```
nmap -p 1-65535 nmapme.labs.internal
```
This will scan all TCP ports on the target host, and display a list of open ports and the services running on each port.

It's important to note that Nmap should only be used against systems and networks that you have been authorised to scan. Scanning systems and networks without proper authorisation can result in legal consequences.

In conclusion, Nmap is a powerful and versatile tool that is essential for network administrators, security professionals, and pentesters. With a little practice and experience, beginners can easily use Nmap to scan for open ports, map network devices, and detect potential security threats.

## Exercise: Scanning All TCP Ports on a Target Host
In this exercise, you will use Nmap to scan all TCP ports on a target host named "nmapme.labs.internal". The aim of this exercise is to become familiar with the basic features and usage of Nmap.

### Step 1: Install Nmap

To install Nmap, you can use the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install nmap
```

### Step 2: Scan the Target Host

To scan the target host, you'll need to run the following command:
```
nmap -p 1-65535 nmapme.labs.internal
```

### Step 3: Analyze the Results

When Nmap has finished scanning the target host, you can analyze the results to identify the open ports and services running on the target. The results will be displayed in the terminal, and will show a list of open ports and the services running on each port.

By completing this exercise, you should have gained a basic understanding of how to use Nmap to scan for open ports on a target host. This is just the beginning, however, and there is much more you can do with Nmap to map networks, detect security threats, and perform vulnerability scans.
