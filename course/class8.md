# Reporting
The reporting stage of a penetration test is a crucial part of the process, as it provides a comprehensive overview of the testing results and serves as a communication tool between the tester and the client. A well-crafted report should contain the following sections:

Executive Summary: This section should provide a high-level overview of the pentest results, including the scope of the test, the vulnerabilities found, and the risk level of each vulnerability.

Scope: This section should clearly define what was in scope and tested during the pentest, including systems, applications, and services. It should also describe any exclusions or limitations that were set for the test.

Methodology: This section should describe the testing methodology used during the pentest, including the tools and techniques used, the steps taken to identify vulnerabilities, and the methodology used to verify the findings.

Vulnerability Details, Evidence, and Risk Assessment: This section should provide detailed information on each vulnerability found during the pentest, including its type, severity, impact, and a description of how it was discovered. It should also include evidence of the vulnerabilities found, such as screenshots, log files, and any other relevant information that can be used to verify the findings. This section should also provide an assessment of the overall risk posed by each vulnerability, including a risk score and an impact statement.

Conclusion: This section should provide a final conclusion on the results of the pentest, including a summary of the findings and any recommendations for remediation.

Appendices: This section should contain any additional information that supports the findings of the pentest, including detailed test data, reference materials, and configuration files.

In conclusion, a good pentest report should provide a comprehensive overview of the testing results, including clear definition of the scope, detailed information on the vulnerabilities found, evidence of the findings, and recommendations for remediation. A well-crafted report not only helps the client to understand the results of the pentest but also serves as a valuable resource for future security assessments and remediation efforts.
