# Reporting
The reporting stage of a pentest is an essential part of the penetration testing process. A well-crafted report not only provides a comprehensive overview of the testing results but also serves as a communication tool between the tester and the client.

A good pentest report should contain the following details:

1. Executive Summary: This section should provide a high-level overview of the pentest results, including the scope of the test, the vulnerabilities found, and the risk level of each vulnerability.
2. Methodology: This section should describe the testing methodology used during the pentest, including the tools and techniques used, the steps taken to identify vulnerabilities, and the methodology used to verify the findings.
3. Vulnerability Details: This section should provide detailed information on each vulnerability found during the pentest, including its type, severity, impact, and a description of how it was discovered. It should also include information on how to mitigate the vulnerability, including recommendations and best practices.
4. Evidence: This section should provide evidence of the vulnerabilities found, including screenshots, log files, and any other relevant information that can be used to verify the findings.
5. Risk Assessment: This section should provide an assessment of the overall risk posed by the vulnerabilities found during the pentest. It should provide a risk score for each vulnerability and an overall risk score for the system or application.
6. Conclusion: This section should provide a final conclusion on the results of the pentest, including a summary of the findings and any recommendations for remediation.
7. Appendices: This section should contain any additional information that supports the findings of the pentest, including detailed test data, reference materials, and configuration files.

In conclusion, a good pentest report should provide a comprehensive overview of the testing results, including detailed information on the vulnerabilities found, evidence of the findings, and recommendations for remediation. A well-crafted report not only helps the client to understand the results of the pentest but also serves as a valuable resource for future security assessments and remediation efforts.
