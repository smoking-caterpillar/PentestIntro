As part of a simulated learning environment, a vulnerable web application has been made available to students on the URL https://labs.internal. This application is accessible via a VPN provided to students and contains several known vulnerabilities that are commonly encountered in real-world web applications. In this article, we'll explore two of these vulnerabilities in detail, including an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability and a file read vulnerability.

The first vulnerability is located at https://labs.internal/api/checkstock and is related to XXE attacks. XXE is a type of attack that takes advantage of a flaw in the way that XML is parsed and processed by vulnerable applications. In this case, the application is vulnerable to XXE because it is accepting XML input without properly validating or sanitising the data. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious XML data into the application, which can then be used to extract sensitive information from the target system.

To demonstrate the severity of this vulnerability, an attacker could craft an XML payload that includes a reference to a local or remote file. If the application is vulnerable to XXE, the attacker's payload will be executed and the contents of the file will be retrieved and returned to the attacker. This could potentially result in the exposure of sensitive information such as passwords, database credentials, or confidential business data.

The second vulnerability is located at https://labs.internal/about?file=about.txt and is related to file read attacks. File read vulnerabilities occur when an application allows an attacker to read sensitive files that are stored on the target system. In this case, the application is vulnerable because it is allowing users to specify the file name in the URL, and it is not properly validating or sanitising the input.

To demonstrate the severity of this vulnerability, an attacker could simply modify the URL to specify a different file name, such as "/etc/passwd". If the application is vulnerable, the attacker's request will be executed and the contents of the specified file will be returned to the attacker. This could potentially result in the exposure of sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and system configuration data.

It is important to note that these vulnerabilities are not limited to the simulated environment provided by the VPN. Real-world web applications can also be vulnerable to similar attacks, and it is critical for organisations to implement proper security controls to protect against these types of threats. This includes regular security testing, regular software updates, and the implementation of robust input validation and sanitisation processes.

In conclusion, the simulated web application located at https://labs.internal is a valuable learning tool for students to understand the dangers of XXE and file read vulnerabilities. By understanding these common attacks, students can better prepare for real-world scenarios and develop a deeper understanding of the importance of security testing and risk mitigation.
